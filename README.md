Non functional requirement: Resizing images, minifying CSS/JS assets, and compressing client-side assets are used here to improve performance by reducing the number and size of files that a browser must download to display the application.
we have used java script  to move a lot of heavy processing tasks from the server – responsible for every client – to the browser where it can be executed much more quickly and in a scalable way. Server-side caching further eliminates the need for servers to engage in time-consuming and resource-intensive processing tasks by storing unchanged data in a static format.
