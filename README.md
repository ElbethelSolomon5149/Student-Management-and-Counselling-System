Non functional requirement: Resizing images, minifying CSS/JS assets, and compressing client-side assets are used here to improve performance by reducing the number and size of files that a browser must download to display the application.
we have used java script  to move a lot of heavy processing tasks from the server – responsible for every client – to the browser where it can be executed much more quickly and in a scalable way. Server-side caching further eliminates the need for servers to engage in time-consuming and resource-intensive processing tasks by storing unchanged data in a static format. The database shall be able to accommodate a minimum of 1,000 records of students. The software shall support use of multiple users at a time. Response queries shall take no longer than 10 seconds. All data storage for user variables will be committed to the database at the time of entry. Data corruption is prevented by applying the possible backup procedures and techniques. All cached data will be rebuilt during every startup. There is no recovery of user data if it is lost. Default values of system data will be assigned when necessary.
